# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Our strategy for testing this system is to unit test with a combination of various blackbox testing techniques.

# 3 Test cases developed

### calculateColumnTotal(Values2D, int);
`calculateColumnTotalTest();`

`calculateColumnTotalTestZero()`

`calculateColumnTotalTestNegative()`

`calculateColumnTotalTestNoRows()`

`calculateColumnTotalTestOtherColumn()`

`calculateColumnTotalTestZeroTotal()`

### calculateRowTotal(Values2D, int);

### clone(double[][]);

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
